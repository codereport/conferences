# **CPPNorth2023**

## July 16-19 2023

It's my second year at CppNorth! Woohoo!! The organizers are great, the venu is great and most importantly, the attendance is great! Such a diverse group of people that all love programming, it's do easy to start a conversation!

Let's go!

## Travel

I chose to go by car, because last year I missed the ending keynote because I had to take my flight back home. This time I wanted to participate in everything, watch everything, and talk to everyone! (almost done!)

I'm traveling from Montreal, so it's a 550KM drive that took 7 hours because the highway 401 got closed to clear out an accident. I'm a speaker this year, so I had the chance to practice my presentation while driving. It took almost the full lenght of the trip to try to remember it, and practice 'punch lines', and I think it was a great exercise. Having the slides in front of us to practice is much different then doing it in our head, and I think it really helped me be more natural in transitions.

Once arrived, I parked the car just beside the venue, got to shower, and then on to the welcome reception!
Got my badge, saluted a couple of people I remembered from last year, and just generally was sooooo excited! The place is packed with C++ legends and great speakers! (Kate gregory, Ben Deane, Matt Godbolt, Timur Doumler, Jessica Karr, all of them!) Everyone was very easy to talk to and the conversations were a great insight at what we would live for the next 3 days....

I find a group of people to get to the 'real' talks.... the after hours meal and beers of course! Conor Hoekstra is a local and helped us find a comfy and quiet place, that our presence quicky made much more lively, hehe. It was very nice to talk to a very diverse group of programmers. We talked about what learned during the day, and of course, I started to spoil some animations and topics from my own talk that is scheduled for tuesday after the Keynote, oh oh ! More on that soon....

I love the city (because of last year's CppNorth) so I walked to the water front to sit and relax before going to bed. The city lights are great at night!

## Day 1

And so it begins!!!

The included breakfast is a welcomed addition by everyone since we can chat a little before going onto the opening keynote! 

Mike Daum gets on stage and starts with the appropriate opening speach, then sets the bar high for Kate Gregory but she absolutely nailed it once again! 

The opening keynote **Steps to Wisdom for C++ Developers** was all about sharing her HUGE experience with us. This is going to be an instant bookmark once it's on Youtube! I loved the segment on 'taking notes' to become the 'expert' and be able to settle arguments using our notes. Also shifting left for people, asking them if they are alright ('Are you ok?'), I already tired and it really helped understand the mindset behind some code.
Before we can even realize it, the keynote is over and is going to have to be re-watched a couple of times :-)

After a quick coffee nreak, I stayed in the 'Vanity Fair' room for **Building Interfaces That Are Hard to Use Incorrectly** By Andreas Weis. Very good intro into hardening interfaces, making good use of scoped enums, structs, designated initializers to prevent the misuse of an interface at compile time, great! As always, never use bool or an arbitrary number for a parameter!!

Then it's time for a quick lunch provided by the conference, woohoo!! This gives us more time to talk and meet new people! C++ passionates like me are aplenty here!!

Then hard decisions time! Miro Knejp and Amir Kirsh are on at the same time as one of my favorite speaker... Ben Deane! His **Calendrical C++: std::chrono, History, Mathematics and the Computus** was just perfect on the amount of usable content (std::chrono uses and placticalities) and funny factoids about calculating the date of easter! So fun! I asked him afterwards if his coding style (auto function return type with trailing named type) was used for aligment or juste personnal stying preference? (Yeah, I ask weird questions sometimes but I read so much code that I like to know the reasoning behind everyone's tastes, hehe)

And then... some talk by Victor Ciura, his **And Then() Some(T)** take on more functionnal programming with std::optional<> and better readability. I use this pattern all the time, but I liked his use of a function to hide to 'box opening' in the optional, a great idea that I immediately take away, haha! Although I prefer the 'pipes' notation, I see how it's easier for readability to have the .or_else() notation for error handling, a most common problem for new hirees!

Ending the day with **C++ and Safety** by Timur Doumler couldn't have been better. The overview of the 'safety' situation and impressions from the 'industry' gave a nice common ground for the rest of the conference. I heared a lot of people talk about safety in a more logical way afterwards. Timur scored big with a reasonable and mature approach to the compromises we have to do to get safe code. Myths were debunked and steps towards safer coding standards were shown.

After the talks, the conference wasn't over! I was invited to the speaker's dinner! A chance to talk about programming and C++ with the leaders of their fields, the cream of the crop! But after some very good food, I realised that we're all alike, only humans doing our best in this ocean of code chaos. I was happy to hear that 'they' were also intimitated by features like co_routines, and that most of them hadn't used Modules yet. Nor MDSpan! Conor told me that he had never seen anyone as excited about Modules as I am, great! Wait and see until I talk about MDSpan then... they are going to be everywhere in my presentation! 

After the dinner, I got to walk around and sit close to the fountain in a park really close to the hotel, the weather was super nice, which let me sink in my thoughts for rehearsing some parts oy my talk...

## Day 2

I had a hard time finding sleep yesterday, I kept thinking about my intro, and my outtro. I woke up very early, and started to remove 2 slides because I thought I would run out of time... I also re-re-re-checked the animations because some of them didn't want to behave yesterday... Pfff..... calm down! I went down for breakfast and a coffee, just one! Because otherwise I'll run around the for the entire talk :-P

But before we start...

Ben Deane's keynote was super nice, and altough I'll have to re-watch it because my mind was sometimes projecting itself in the very near future, I could related to the parts when he was talking about the *good* king of lazyness, testing is not easy, let's make it as easy to contribute to as possible, and that part about not overthinking for change, but acknowledge that change will in fact come. 

Great pacing, time flew, and it's now already time to prepare for mine! Grabbed some water, plugged in the laptop, got to chat a bit, got micced and....

People started to show up... (Matt Godbolt and Ben Deane front row for me!!! Thanks a lot!!!)
