# **CPPNorth2023**

## July 16-19 2023

It's my second year at CppNorth! Woohoo!! The organizers are great, the venu is great and most importantly, the attendance is great! Such a diverse group of people that all love programming, it's do easy to start a conversation!

Let's go!

## Travel

I chose to go by car, because last year I missed the ending keynote becouse I had to take my flight back home. This time I wanted to participate in everything, watch everything, and talk to everyone! (almost done!)

I'm traveling from Montreal, so it's a 550KM drive that took 7 hours because the highway 401 got closed to clear out an accident. I'm a speaker this year, so I had the chance to practice my presentation while driving. It took almost the full lenght of the trip to try to remember it, and practice 'punch lines', and I think it was a great exercise. Having the slides in front of us to practice is much different then doing it in our head, and I think it really helped me be more natural in transitions.

Once arrived, I parked the car just beside the venue, got to shower, and then on to the welcome reception!
Got my badge, saluted a couple of people I remembered from last year, and just generally was sooooo excited! The place is packed with C++ legends and great speakers! (Kate gregory, Ben Deane, Matt Godbolt, Timur Doumler, Jessica Karr, all of them!) Everyone was very easy to talk to and the conversations were a great insight at what we would live for the next 3 days....

I love the city (because of last year's CppNorth) so I walked to the water front to sit and relax before going to bed. The city lights are great at night!
